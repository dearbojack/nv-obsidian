# NV-Obsidian

Using Obsidian like [Notation Velocity](https://notational.net/) and [nvalt](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/). Hugely inspired by both. The philosophy behind the configuration is "Keep It Simple and Stupid"(KISS).

All I want from a note-taking application is taking notes and accessing them effortlessly. I don't care much about the fancy graphs, canvas, or various links in the beginning. I want to reduce the stress of opening the app and start taking notes. 

In this template vault, there is no third-party plugins and most of the core plugins are disabled except for:

1. Quick Switcher, to search and create notes.
2. Search, to do a full-text search.
3. File, to show the file/folder list.

## How to use

Download the repo as zip and unzip. Copy / move your notes into the `nv-obsidian` folder.

**To create a note**, `Ctrl + O` , type its title and press return. Or edit existing notes. **To search in the note vault**, `Ctrl + Shift + F`.

That's it. No other fuss.
