# NV-Obsidian

Using Obsidian like [Notation Velocity](https://notational.net/) and [nvalt](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/). Hugely inspired by both.

All I want from a note-taking application is taking notes and accessing them effortlessly. I don't care much about the fancy graphs, canvas, or various links in the beginning. I want to reduce the stress of opening the app and start taking notes. 

In this template vault, there is no third-party plugins and most of the core plugins are disabled except for:

1. Quick Switcher, to search and create notes.
2. Search, to do a full-text search.
3. File, to show the file/folder list.

## Hotkey

Those are default hotkeys:
1. `Ctrl + O` to search for notes and create notes if there is no matching titles.
2. `Ctrl + Shift + F` to do a full-text search.
